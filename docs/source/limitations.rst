Limitations
===========

The library is generally limited to the functionality provided by the RPI interface, therefore any functionality
missing from this interface will also be missing from the library.

Some notable examples:

    * It's not possible to configure state clocks
    * Inverse Assemblers cannot be loaded automatically

In addition some of the functionality present in the RPI interface is not currently implemented, such as:

    * Support for osciloscope modules
    * Support for simulation modules
    * support for pattern generation modules
